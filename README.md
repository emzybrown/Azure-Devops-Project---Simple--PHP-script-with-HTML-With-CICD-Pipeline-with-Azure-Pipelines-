# Azure-DevOps-Project---Simple-PHP-script-with-HTML
This is part of my Azure DevOps Training -  Built a simple PHP script with HTML.  When you input your name on the form, it outputs a statement eg Hello, Emeka! nice to meet you

Code index.php is sitting on my PC, accessed with Visual Studio IDE
Any changes to the code are reviewed and commit & push to the remote git repository - Azure Repos
Built a CI/CD Pipeline with Azure Pipelines - code from Azure repos is built and deployed to the Azure web app running php PHP stack
Code is tested and a production release pipeline is created to release code to production.
