# Azure-DevOps-Project---Simple-PHP-script-with-HTML
Preamble: This is part of my Azure DevOps Training -  I built a simple PHP script with HTML.  When you input your name on the form, it outputs a statement eg Hello, Emeka! nice to meet you

1, Code index.php is sitting on my PC, accessed with Visual Studio IDE
2. Any changes to the code are reviewed and commit & push to the remote git repository - Azure Repos
3. Built a CI/CD Pipeline with Azure Pipelines - code from Azure repos is built and deployed to the Azure web app running php PHP stack
4. The code is tested, and a release pipeline is created to release the code and deploy it to the Azure web app.
5. Azure web app link to access the PHP code - "azurewebapplink".azurewebsites.net
